# Hello

I like computer stuff. Thats it.

Here is something interesting.
A bunch of programming languages saying Hello World!

#### C
I love her, seriously she is easy to learn and hard to use :)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	printf("Hello, World!") ;
}
```

#### C++
This dude is freaking giant. Compared to his mother he is
huge. I don't like him very much (probably 'cause i am stupid).
But he is good none the less does everything perfectly (most of the time)

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main(void)
{
	std::cout << "Hello, World" << std::endl ;
}
```

#### Java
I won't use any human pronouns to describe Java. I have no emotional
connection to it. It can rot in tartarus for all I care. Nah just kidding
he is good too just a little verbose.

```java
public class Fx
{
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
	}
}
```

#### Python
Exactly like C except her syntax eats dirt for dinner. And she is sllooowwww...
but i won't hold any of this against her 'cause she was designed to teach biginners
programming which she does perfectly.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

#### Lisp
Oh man lisp is near to God. Hard to comprehend, will require more than a human lifetime to
master completely and can do literal wizardry.

```lisp
(print "Hello, World!")
```

#### Scheme
scheme is just lisp for mere mortals like us

```scheme
(display "Hello, World!\n")
```

#### Ada
Ada is just C++ on steroids. She is used by the US Military that says a lot

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO ;
use Ada.Text_IO ;

procedure Main is
begin
	Put_Line("Hello, World") ;
end Main ;
```
