# Hello, World!!

I am NimComPoo the most stupid highschool student in 
existance. Now I can assure you that even if I am 
stupid I like CS. I like to study about computers
and Nature. (that sound like biotech but ok...)

So Now I have a lot of time to kill so I will list out
a bunch of hello world in different programming languages.
Enjoy...

## C (the best language in existance)
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **args)
{
	/*using puts instead of printf to just spice shit up*/ 

	puts("Hello, World!!\n") ;
	return EXIT_SUCCESS ;
}
```

## C++ (good but not as good as its father)
```c++
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char **args)
{
	std::cout << "Hello, World!!" << std::endl ;
}
```

## java (the worst langauge in existance)
```java
public class Welcome
{
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		System.out.println("Hello, World!!") ;
	}	
}
```

## python (i don't like it but ok)
```python
def main():
	print("Hello, World!!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
	main()
```

## lua (as sweet as the moon)
```lua
function main()
	print("Hello, World!!")
end

main()
```

## ada (C++ on steroids)
```ada
with Ada.Text_IO ;
use Ada.Text_IO ;

procedure main is 
begin
	Put_Line("Hello, World!!") ;
end
```
## lisp (i don't have one but all the peps who do y'all are very cute ðŸ˜º
```lisp
(print "Hello World!!\n")
```

## scheme (lisp but a lot more chad)
```scm
(display "Hello, World!\n")
```

## Ocaml (blew my mind, will blow yours too)
```ocaml
print_string("Hello, World!!\n") ;;
```

## Rust (i like ferric chloride more ðŸ˜†)
```rust
fn main(){
	println!("Hello, World!\n")
}
```
